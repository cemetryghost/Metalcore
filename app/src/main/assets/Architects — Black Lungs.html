        Оригинальный текст:<br><br>

        Do you cross your heart when you hope to die?<br>
        Are you sleeping deep in the hurricane?<br>
        IVs in the arm, forgetting to feel, we're crawling on all fours<br>
        Will you fall on that sword at the second coming?<br>
        You're gonna taste the ash and dust<br>
        'Cause this world is dying in our arms<br><br>

        Now the wheels are turning<br>
        What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?<br><br>

        You wanna make your Hell a reality?<br>
        Black lungs for the young if they dare to breathe<br>
        (If they dare to breathe, whoa-oh)<br>
        Sure sounds like Heaven to me<br>
        You've gotta cut the roots to kill the weeds<br>
        No place to go if we don't believe<br>
        (If we don't believe, whoa-oh)<br>
        Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint<br><br>

        Give us a Judas steer we can deify<br>
        Yeah, we all pretend we're the renegades<br>
        So wash us away, garroted by a halo, take a bow 'cause time's running out<br>
        There's no doubt that the end is coming<br>
        You're gonna taste the ash, you're gonna taste the dust<br>
        'Cause this world is dying in our arms<br><br>

        Now the wheels are turning<br>
        What would you do to stay alive if the planet was burning?<br><br>

        Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint<br><br>

        Good Lord, it's enough to plague a saint<br><br>

        Post-love, post-truth<br>
        Justice lays bound and black-bagged, ready for the guillotine<br>
        We can all plead guilty when they ask<br>
        "Where were you when the gods clipped the wings off the phoenix?"<br>
        They clipped the wings off the phoenix, oh<br>
        When will we wrestle the world from the fools and their gold and the fucking covenant? (We'll be waiting)<br>
        Will enough be enough when we're holding on for dear life?<br><br>

        Good lord, it's enough to plague a saint<br><br>

        It's enough to plague a saint<br>
        It's enough to plague a saint<br>
        It's enough to plague a saint<br><br>

        Oh<br>
        Ugh, we can all plead guilty when they ask<br>
        "Where were you when the gods clipped the wings off the phoenix?"
