        Diamond, diamond in the mud<br>
        Infinity is waiting there<br>
        'Cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral<br><br>

        I do my best, but everything seems ominous<br>
        Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite<br>
        This shouldn't feel so monotonous<br>
        It never rains, but it pours<br><br>

        We're just a bunch of fucking animals<br>
        But we're afraid of the outcome<br>
        Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in<br>
        Says I should pull the pin<br><br>

        Should I just pull the pin?<br>
        Should I just pull the pin?<br><br>

        I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot<br>
        The ground gave way, now I've lost the plot<br>
        Fucked it again, that was all I've got<br>
        It never rains, but it pours<br><br>

        Life is just a dream within a<br><br>

        We'rе just a bunch of fucking animals<br>
        But we're afraid of the outcomе<br>
        Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in<br>
        Says I should pull the pin<br><br>

        Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud<br>
        Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral<br><br>

        Dream within a, dream within a<br><br>

        We're just a bunch of fucking animals<br>
        But we're afraid of the outcome<br>
        Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in<br>
        Says I should pull the pin<br>
        We're just a bunch of fucking animals<br>
        But we're afraid of the outcome<br>
        Don't cry to me because the fiction that we're living in<br>
        Says I should pull the pin<br><br>

        Should I just pull the pin?<br>
        Should I just pull the pin?<br>
        (Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud)<br>
        Should I just pull the pin?<br>
        (Infinity is waiting there 'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral)<br>
        Should I just pull the pin?<br>
