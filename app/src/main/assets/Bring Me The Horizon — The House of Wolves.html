        Оригинальный текст:<br><br>

        Show me a sign, show me a reason to give<br>
        A solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs<br>
        I'm going blind, but one thing's clear<br>
        Death is the only salvation you'll feel<br>

        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        Brick by brick by brick<br><br>

        What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse<br>
        Cloak and daggers murder the truth<br>
        The bitter taste, there's nothing else<br>
        I'll bow for your king when he shows himself<br><br>

        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        These walls begin to cave in<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        Whispers in a thousand tongues<br>

        Show me your face, show me a reason to think<br>
        My soul can be saved if I sell you my sins<br>
        I'm going blind, but one thing's clear<br>
        Death is the only salvation for me<br><br>

        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        These walls begin to cave in<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        Whispers in a thousand tongues<br><br>

        The house of wolves you built<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        Will burn just like a thousand suns<br><br>

        Yeah<br>
        And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see<br>
        Is two foot wide and six foot deep, yeah<br>
        And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see<br>
        Is two foot wide and six foot deep<br>
        And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see<br>
        Is two foot wide and six foot deep, oh<br><br>

        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        Brick by brick by brick<br><br>

        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        These walls begin to cave in<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        Whispers in a thousand tongues<br>
        Brick by brick by brick<br>
        These walls begin to cave in<br>
        The house of wolves you built<br>
        Will burn just like a thousand suns<br>

        You said you want me<br>
        Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here<br>
        You said you want me<br>
        Now I'm here, now I'm here, now I'm here
