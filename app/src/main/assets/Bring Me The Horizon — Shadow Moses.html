        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)<br>
        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)<br><br>

        I thought I'd buried you and covered the tracks<br>
        You'll have to take this with your cold dead hands<br>
        I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die<br>
        I thought I'd cut you loose, severed the feeling<br>
        I slipped through the cracks and you caved in my ceiling<br>
        I thought I'd buried you, what's dead can never die, fuck<br><br>

        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)<br>
        You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)<br>
        Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)<br><br>

        This is sempiternal<br>
        Will we ever see the end?<br>
        This is sempiternal<br>
        Over and over, again and again<br>
        Rise from the dead, you say<br>
        Secrets don't sleep till they're took to the grave<br>
        Signal the sirens rally the troops<br>
        Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment of truth<br><br>

        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)<br>
        You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)<br>
        Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We're going nowhere)<br>
        We live our lives like we're ready to die (We're going nowhere)<br>
        You can run, but you'll never escape (Over and over again)<br>
        Will we ever see the end? (We're going nowhere)<br><br>

        This is sempiternal<br>
        Will we ever see the end?<br>
        This is sempiternal<br>
        Over and over, again and again
