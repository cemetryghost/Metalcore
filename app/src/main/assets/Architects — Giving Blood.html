        Оригинальный текст:<br><br>

        The gospel, distorted<br>
        It leaves my blood running cold<br>
        But still they say<br>
        I'm rigging the ritual<br><br>

        I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers<br>
        Bleeding out like a devil in disguise<br>
        They shot a hole in the parachute<br>
        'Cause I'd rather feel alive<br><br>

        It's so convoluted<br>
        They're just trepanning for gold<br>
        May they rest in peace<br>
        'Cause they're fucking dead to me<br>
        Well, there's your eulogy<br>
        The water's polluted<br>
        My feathers caught in the spill<br>
        Nobody said that it would be safe up here<br><br>

        I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers<br>
        Bleeding out like a devil in disguise<br>
        They shot a hole in the parachute<br>
        'Cause I'd rather feel alive<br><br>

        Your salvation's a letdown, ooh<br>
        Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel, I'd rather feel alive<br><br>

        It leaves a mark on the mind, it weaves a web in the background silently<br>
        No time to spare, no sign of the exit wound, God help me<br>
        There's no drying off once you're soaked right down to the bone, hopefully<br>
        Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath, woe is me<br>
        It leaves a mark on the mind, it weaves a web in the background silently<br>
        No time to spare, no sign of the exit wound, God help me<br>
        There's no drying off once you're soaked right down to the bone, hopefully<br>
        Somebody thinks of me in the aftermath, woe is me<br>
        Woe is me<br>
        I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry<br><br>

        I never said that I was giving blood for the unbelievers<br>
        Bleeding out like a devil in disguise<br>
        They shot a hole in the parachute<br>
        'Cause I'd rather feel alive<br><br>

        Your salvation's a letdown, ooh<br>
        Oh, I'm sorry that I'd rather feel, I'd rather feel alive<br>
