        Оригинальный текст:<br><br>

        Look into my face, then look again<br>
        We are not the same, we're different<br>
        To tell your tales and fables, you couldn't wait<br>
        You need a new clean slate without the dents<br>
        A place to put your pain, your consequence<br>
        When you look into the mirror, are you even there?<br><br>

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell<br>
        It's hard enough being alone with myself<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br>
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant well<br>
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br><br>

        So write a brand new page then write again<br>
        I know your act is staged, yet you pretend<br>
        All while you're turning tables with missing legs<br>
        I think you've overstayed your welcome in<br>
        So go the fuck away, don't come again<br>
        I'll see your face in the fire and burn it out<br><br>

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell<br>
        It's hard enough being alone with myself<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br>
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant well<br>
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br><br>

        Like a villain, I couldn't be<br>
        I didn't need it, it needed me<br>
        Like a villain, I couldn't be<br>
        I didn't need it, it needed me<br><br>

        I didn't need it, it needed me<br><br>

        I don't wanna know all your secrets 'cause I'll tell<br>
        It's hard enough being alone with myself<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br>
        I know you tried your hardest, I know that you meant well<br>
        But you pushed me to the edge and I slipped and then I fell<br>
        I don't know how long I'll be holding on<br><br>

        I didn't need it, it needed me
