        I made another mistake, thought I could change<br>
        Thought I could make it out<br>
        Promises break, need to hear you say<br>
        "You're gonna keep it now"<br><br>

        I miss the way you say my name<br>
        The way you bend, the way you break<br>
        Your makeup running down your face<br>
        The way you touch, the way you taste<br><br>

        When the curtains call the time,<br>
        Will we both go home alive?<br>
        It wasn't hard to realize <br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br><br>

        You're in the walls that I made, with crosses and frames<br>
        Hanging upside down<br>
        For granted, in vain, I took everything<br>
        I ever cared about<br><br>

        I miss the way you say my name<br>
        The way you bend, the way you break<br>
        Your makeup running down your face<br>
        The way you fuck, the way you taste<br><br>

        When the curtains call the time,<br>
        Will we both go home alive?<br>
        It wasn't hard to realize <br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br>
        When the curtains call the time, <br>
        Will we both be satisfied?<br>
        It wasn't hard to realize <br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br><br>

        You come and go in waves<br>
        Leaving me in your wake<br>
        You come and go in waves<br>
        Swallowing everything<br>

        Are you satisfied?<br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br>
        Mind<br>
        Mind<br><br>

        When the curtains call the time,<br>
        Will we both go home alive?<br>
        It wasn't hard to realize <br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br>
        When the curtains call the time, <br>
        Will we both be satisfied?<br>
        It wasn't hard to realize <br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br>
        Love's the death of peace of mind<br><br>

        Love's the death of peace of mind
