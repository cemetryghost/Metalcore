        There are two parts of me, so now it's like a war<br>
        I've never seen God to ask him what I'm looking for<br>
        I've never seen the rules, I try to play this game<br>
        So what is your name? I'm meeting doomsday<br>
        But I still don't know to whom do I pray<br>
        This can never reform mankind 'cause this is slavery<br>
        You can't answer what you try to find, it's tragedy<br>
        Where have you been when I needed to breathe?<br>
        So where have you been when I needed to breathe?<br><br>

        I lost my faith somewhere inside, inside<br>
        I lose myself somewhere in faith, in faith<br><br>

        I came all this way for you<br>
        But I still don't know how you look<br>
        And I still don't know what I choose<br>
        Is that truth? Give me light, is that truth?<br>
        I've never heard any echo<br>
        They're all gone, they're all gone<br>
        There is no Hell, there is no Heaven<br>
        There is no life on the other side<br><br>

        There is no Hell, there is no Heaven<br>
        There's no life on the other side<br><br>

        I lost my faith somewhere inside, inside<br>
        I lose myself somewhere in faith, in faith, in faith<br><br>

        I lost my faith somewhere inside, inside<br>
        I lose myself somewhere in faith, in faith<br><br>
