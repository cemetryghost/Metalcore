        I thought I\'d cut you loose, severed the feeling\n
        I slipped through the cracks and you caved in my ceiling\n
        I thought I\'d buried you, what\'s sin can never die,\n\n

        Fuck\n\n

        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We\'re going nowhere)\n
        We live our lives like we\'re ready to die (We\'re going nowhere)\n
        You can run, but you\'ll never escape (Over and over again)\n
        Will we ever see the end? (We\'re going nowhere)\n

        This is sempiternal\n
        Will we ever see the end?\n
        This is sempiternal\n
        Over and over, again and again\n\n

        Rise from the dead, you say\n
        Secrets don\'t sleep till they\'re took to the grave\n
        Signal the sirens rally the troops\n
        Ladies and gentlemen, it\'s the moment of truth\n\n

        Can you tell from the look in our eyes? (We\'re going nowhere)\n
        We live our lives like we\'re ready to die (We\'re going nowhere)\n
        You can run, but you\'ll never escape (Over and over again)\n
        Will we ever see the end? (We\'re going nowhere)\n\n
