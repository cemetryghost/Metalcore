        <p>I can\'t read my mind, no idea who am I \n
        I\'ve seen the people kill themselves \n
        I\'ve seen them lost inside their heads \n
        This monster can grab anyone \n
        Only the dream can help \n \n
        I run away for something more \n
        I run away, please close the door \n

        I gotta focus on the things really worth it \n
        And now all pain is gone, I gotta count on myself \n
        First day I couldn\'t believe it \n
        Next week I had to admit it \n
        Last couple days we\'ve spent together \n

        <p>There are two parts of me, so now it\'s like a war \n
        I\'ve never seen God to ask him what I\'m looking for \n
        I\'ve never seen the rules, I try to play this game \n
        So what is your name? I\'m meeting doomsday \n
        But I still don\'t know to whom do I pray \n
        This can never reform mankind \'cause this is slavery \n
        You can\'t answer what you try to find, it\'s tragedy \n
        Where have you been when I needed to breathe? \n
        So where have you been when I needed to breathe? \n \n
        I lost my faith somewhere inside, inside \n
        I lose myself somewhere in faith, in faith \n \n
        I came all this way for you \n
        But I still don\'t know how you look \n
        And I still don\'t know what I choose \n
        Is that truth? Give me light, is that truth? \n
        I\'ve never heard any echo \n
        They\'re all gone, they\'re all gone \n

        <p>I do my best, but everything seems ominous\n
Not feeling blessed, quite the opposite\n
This shouldn\'t feel so monotonous\n
It never rains, but it pours\n\n

We\'re just a bunch of fucking animals\n
But we\'re afraid of the outcome\n
Don\'t cry to me because the fiction that we\'re living in\n
Says I should pull the pin\n\n

Should I just pull the pin?\n
Should I just pull the pin?\n\n

I dug my heels, I thought that I could stop the rot\n
The ground gave way, now I\'ve lost the plot\n
Fucked it again, that was all I\'ve got\n
It never rains, but it pours\n\n

Life is just a dream within a\n\n

We\'rе just a bunch of fucking animals\n
But we\'re afraid of the outcomе\n
Don\'t cry to me because the fiction that we\'re living in\n

Buried under dirt, a diamond in the mud\n
Infinity is waiting there \'cause nobody can burn a glass cathedral\n\n

Dream within a, dream within a\n\n
